             <div className="mt-6">
                <p className="font-normal italic">We&apos;ve updated our Privacy Policy below. These updates apply to all citizens of the world.</p>
                <p>Ludd AI respects your privacy and is strongly committed to keeping secure any information we obtain from you or about you. This Privacy Policy describes our practices with respect to any Personal Information we might possibly collect from or about you when you use our website, applications, and services (collectively, &quot;Services&quot;).</p>
                <p>We don&apos;t &quot;sell&quot; Personal Information or &quot;share&quot; Personal Information for behavioral advertising. We also don&apos;t process sensitive Personal Information for the purposes of inferring characteristics about a consumer.</p>
                <h2>TL;DR</h2>
                <p className="font-normal italic">If you do not consent to the possible collection of Personal Information, please exercise your right to privacy by discontinuing your use of this website.</p>
                

                <h2>Privacy Caveat</h2>
                <p>Most companies, organizations, and general purveyors of web services are not fully aware, if even remotely aware, of the data and personal information being collected directly by way of the web services they provide or indirectly by way of affiliates, partners, and web service solution vendors. This state of affairs can be attributed to a number of non-exclusive factors including but not limited to: greed, ambition, ignornace, malfeasance, error, and confusion resulting from a rapidly changing technological landscape.</p>
                <p>Ludd AI takes privacy seriously, but Ludd AI uses a technology stack with dependencies, ultimately even including the means by which you the user accesses our Services, that Ludd AI cannot answer fully for with respect to data collection practices or impractices, as the case may be.</p>
                
                <h2>Personal information we collect</h2>
